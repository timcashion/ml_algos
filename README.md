# Machine Learning Algorithms Visualization  
[IN PROGRESS]

Simplified visualizations for common machine learning algorithms.  

- Starting with regression based models and data   
- This application is used for a simplified form (single independent variable) of many regression based machine learning problems.  
- The model is trained and tested on randomly generated data with a known relationship and gaussian noise  
- The type of relationship, and two different models can be controlled by the user to inspect the differences between them visually.

## App
https://timcashion-ml-algos-app-cdpn4x.streamlitapp.com/

OR 

Run streamlit app locally  
```
pip install streamlit  
git clone https://github.com/timcashion/ml_algos  
streamlit run app.py  
```


## To do:  
1. Add classification based models and dropdown menu that would influence model choices 
1. Map to additional transformed linear models
1. Add dictionary mapping for models to address other forms
1. Add error metrics table for models (regression: RMSE, MSE)
